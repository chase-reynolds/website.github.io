		<h2>Programming Experience</h2>
			<h3>This Website!</h3>
			<section class="project">
				<section class="project-child">
					<p>I created this website to learn HTML, CSS, javascript, and PHP. Currently, the site is only using HTML and CSS, but I would like to incorporate javascript and PHP in the future. Furthermore, I plan for this site to host future web-based projects that I pursue. The ultimate purpose of this site is to exhibit my programming capabilities and engineering portfolio for future employers.</p>

			<h3>Combining datasources with MySQL</h3>
			<section class="project">
				<section class="project-child">
					<p>I used Zoho Reports to grab datasets from Quickbooks and Tsheets. Then I used MySQL to create queries that combined the datasets depending on how they needed to be grouped. Then I displayed these queries with Zoho Reports which looked like an  Excel layout with conditional formatting. The reports allowed the managers to see the status of all the jobs and provided instant access to engineering drawings anywhere they had an internet connection.</p>

			<h3>Combining multiple reports with VBA</h3>
			<section class="project">
				<section class="project-child">
					<p>I used VBA to compare exported datasets from different sources. One of the sources was the company's ERP software, while the other was proprietary software from their primary customer. The VBA code would fix the data and filter based on specific parameters, then combine them into useful information.</p>

		<h2>Designing</h2>
			<h3>Rotating Laser Cutter</h3>
			<section class="project">
				<section class="project-child">
			<p>Paradigm Metals Inc. is a precision manufacturing facility. Due to some of the new orders, they wanted to start cutting rectangular tubing to length with a laser cutter. After some research, I designed a rotating chuck that stops every 90 degrees in Fusion360. The chuck would clamp any rectangular tubing and keep it level while the laser cut it. Then it would be able to rotate 90 degrees without changing the x and y coordinates for a clean cut.</p>

			<h3>Paint Rack</h3>
			<section class="project">
				<section class="project-child">
			<p>To optimize space for Paradigm Metals Inc. I designed storable paint racks. They can fold down to be stacked on top of one another when not in use. They are also easy to put together with just some screws and have multiple levels for adjustability. If implemented, these racks could decrease wasted floor space in an area that is already space-constrained with their workload.</p>
