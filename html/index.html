				<p>Howdy! My name is Chase Reynolds, and this is my website! I am an Industrial Engineer with minors in Business and Math from Texas A&M University. My passions involve learning, creating, and physical activity. In my free time, I often learn about different programming languages and applications that I think will be useful for my professional career and personal projects. When I have the time, I like to work on projects where I create something useful.</p>

			<h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>While attending university, I have narrowed my areas of interest to programming and design. Programming has always been engaging to me, and I enjoy how it can be such a powerful solution to many problems in a business. I like working with datasets to create something that can be easily understood and useful. Designing is another area that I find interesting. Whether it's designing a product in SolidWorks or creating a floor layout, the design process has always been an exciting experience. I find it fascinating how many different approaches can be taken to solve a problem and how you're initial design may look nothing like the final product.</p>

					<h3>Free Time</h3>
					<p>I enjoy learning and creating more than anything in my free time. My projects drive my passion for learning by requiring new skills to make a creative solution. Generally, I think of something that will be interesting or fun, and I learn what I need to know. For instance, one of my hobbies is 3D printing. It is incredible how I can think of something useful, model it in SolidWorks, and have a working model within days! Physical activity is also a priority in my life. I enjoy training to acquire new skills and increase my physical performance while relieving stress. After a workout, I feel more productive during the day and all-around more healthy. Right now, I am working on the planche and handstand just because I think they are difficult moves that interest me. I think it's also essential to incorporate practical physical activity which is why I am currently practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
